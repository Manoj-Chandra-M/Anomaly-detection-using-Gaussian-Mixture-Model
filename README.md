# Anomaly-detection-using-Gaussian-Mixture-Model
1) The project aims to detect the fraudulent and valid credit card transactions using multi-variate gaussian mixture models.<br>
2) Implemented 10 different gaussian models on fraudulent and non-fraudulent data with varying number of components to analyze the outliers.<br>
3) Reported precision, recall and F1 score on both training and validation sets for all the models. The best model obtained had F1 score of 0.81
